        <h2>What are agent based models?</h2>
            <p2> Agent based models are created to simulate the actions of and interactions between individual agents (these can represent people, aninmals, cells and so on) which enables us to visualise and assess their effects on the environment in which they exist. As part of on of my core modules at the University of Leeds, 'GEOG5995 Programming for Social Scientists: Core Skills', I have been tasked with creating an agent based model which represents sheep (the agents) interacting in an environment (a field for example). I have programmed a variety of behaviours and interactions for example the sheep 'eat' the environment as the navigate around it, in doing so they increase their food 'store' which can result in them moving further in the envirnment or being sick if their 'store' exceeds a certain fullness. The links below enable you to download the code to produce an animation of the agent based model I have produced, the agent framework that includes the various interactions and behaviours of the agents, and the environment they exist within.</p2>
